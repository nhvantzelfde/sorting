# sorting
Sorting methods and implementation

Insertion sort - O(n^2) time, in-place
Merge sort - O(n lg n) time, O(n) additional space
Heap sort - O(n lg n) time, can be done in place but this uses O(n) additional space
Quick sort - O(n^2) worst case, O(n lg n) average, in-place
Quick sort uses either last element or random element as pivot
